# ArtificialIntelligenceGameProject-Abandoned
Unity game project for GAME3001 George Brown College

## Project Status
Abandoned because there is too much cluster of different art packages that wasn't needed for a prototype.

Restarted project at [GAME3001GameProject](https://github.com/aytona/GAME3001GameProject)

### Things I've learned
* Use Nav Mesh next time
* Use enums for enemy types (or different types in general)
* Separate an enemy attack script and a player attack script (don't make a generic attack script, it's more work)
* Prototype using prototype package
* Don't import art assets until it is needed
